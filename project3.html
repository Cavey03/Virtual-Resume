            <h1>Simple peer to peer messaging system with node.js</h1>

            
            <p>Built a peer to peer messaging system where both users have to be online to recieve and send messages to each other.</p>

            <p>This was the first time I used node.js and sockets. It helped greatly in my broader understanding of Front end and backend development. I decided on this as we had a group assignment simular and I wanted to get a grasp of how sockets etc works before starting with it.</p>
