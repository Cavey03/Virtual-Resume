            <h1>Built a simple discord bot with NASA(IOD) API integrattion</h1>

            
            <p>This was the first project that really got me into API's and integration</p>

            <p>The main idea was to create a bot that would respond to users quesries, greet them or say goodbye, tell a joke and finally on request, pull the NASA image of the day and display it to the user in an embed with aditional information</p>
