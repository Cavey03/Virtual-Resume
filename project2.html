            <h1>Built a discord bot with Riot Games API integration.</h1>

            
            <p>The purpose of this bot is to generate a certain amount of random champions when the appropriate command is typed. It then checks how many people are in the voice channel and based on that, generate random champions along with lore, an immage of the champion and ability information and cost.
            </p>

            <p>I really enjoyed this project and me and my friends still use it when we play League</p>
